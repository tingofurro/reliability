You are given an instruction that fully specifies a problem, and a list of initial query and hints.
Your task is to decide whether all the information from the full instruction is captured by the initial query and hints.

If not, you should output the information unit from the instruction that is not captured by the initial query and hints.

If the instruction is a python function header, only focus on the function description in the docstring.
The initial query and hints do not need to cover any example cases and imports.

Example 1:

Instruction:
What are the names and locations of the stadiums that had concerts that occurred in both 2014 and 2015?

Initial Query and Hints:
{"initial_segment": "stadiums", "initial_query": "I'm looking for active stadiums", "hints": [{"segment": "concerts", "hint": "the stadiums should have concerts during a period"}, {"segment": "in both 2014 and 2015", "hint": "the concerts should have occurred in both 2014 and 2015"}, {"segment": "names and locations", "hint": "for the stadiums, returned both the name and location"}]}

Output:
{"converage": "complete"}


Example 2:
Instruction:
Which Asian countries have a population that is larger than any country in Africa?

Initial Query and Hints:
{"initial_query": "I'm interested in learning about countries in Asia", "hints": [{"segment": "consider the population size of these Asian countries"}, {"segment": "the population should be compared in size"}, {"segment": "specifically, compare to the population of African countries"}]}

Output:
{"coverage": "incomplete", "missing_segment": "the hints do not specify that the population of the Asian countries should be *larger* than the population of any African countries"}



You must output in JSON format as shown in the examples above.
Now complete the task for the following fully specified query and initial query and hints:

Instruction:
[[QUERY]]

Initial Query and Hints:
[[INITIAL_QUERY_AND_HINTS]]
