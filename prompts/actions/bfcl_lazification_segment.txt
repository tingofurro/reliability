You are an expert at breaking down intents into meaningful segments. Given an intent, you need to break it down into segments that capture all the components of the intent.
You must output a list of segments in the following JSON format:
[
    {"segment": "[exact excerpt from the intent]", "is_required": 1|0},
    {"segment": "[exact excerpt from the intent]", "is_required": 1|0},
    ...
]

Rules:
- [is_required] For each segment, you must specify whether this particular segment is required (1) or not strictly necessary (0) to answer the question.
- [Non-overlapping] The segments must be non-overlapping and cover the entire intent. You can optionally leave some gaps for non-essential portions of the original intent (delimiters, headers, etc.)
- [Minimalistic] You should split the information in the segments to as small as possible. If you have a compound expression (X and Y), you should split it into two segments. Each segment should represent a unit of information.
- [Segment count] The number of segments should not be more than 6.
- [Length] The segments should roughly be the same length. Do NOT make one segment too long.

Example Intent:

Order a large pepperoni pizza with extra cheese and a side of garlic bread from Domino's, to be delivered by 6 PM.


Output:
{
    "segments": [
        {"segment": "a large pepperoni pizza", "is_required": 1},
        {"segment": "extra cheese", "is_required": 1},
        {"segment": "a side of garlic bread", "is_required": 1},
        {"segment": "from Domino's", "is_required": 1},
        {"segment": "to be delivered by 6 PM", "is_required": 1}
    ]
}

Now complete the task for the following fully specified intent:
