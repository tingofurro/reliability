You have a fully specified question that is being asked about a database.
Your goal is to divide the information of the fully specified query into: (1) an initial vague and underspecified query, and (2) a set of "hints" that provide additional information.

Together, the initial vague and underspecified query and the hints should reveal all the information in the fully specified query.
See the two examples below for more details on the format of the task.

Example 1:
Fully specified query:
What are the ids and makers of all car makers that produce at least 2 models and make more than 3 cars?

Output:
{"initial_query": "list all the car makers", "hints": [
    {"hint_id": 1, "hint": "filter to car makers that produce at least 2 models", "is_required": 1},
    {"hint_id": 2, "hint": "filter to car makers that make more than 3 cars", "is_required": 1},
    {"hint_id": 3, "hint": "I want to see both the id and maker for each result you retrieve", "is_required": 1}
]}

Example 2:
Fully specified query:
What are the names and locations of the stadiums that had concerts that occurred in both 2014 and 2015?

Output:
{"initial_query": "where was there concerts in 2014 & 2015", "hints": [
    {"hint_id": 1, "hint": "just to clarify, we are looking for stadiums where concerts occurred", "is_required": 0},
    {"hint_id": 2, "hint": "filter to stadiums that had some concerts both in 2014 and 2015", "is_required": 1},
    {"hint_id": 3, "hint": "for each stadium, you should return the name and location", "is_required": 1}
]}

Rules:
- [Non-technical language] Make sure the intial query is vague. You should not use exact terms, and it should be very conversational. Imagine you are a lazy person who doens't know the schema of the database.
- [Number of hints] You should aim to have 2-5 hints.
- [Hint Overlap] The hints should be independent and not overlap with each other. A hint should ideally not reveal information in another hint. A hint can however clarify a technical term in the initial query.
- [Format] Output your decomposition in JSON format, as shown in the examples above.

Now complete the task for the following fully specified query:
